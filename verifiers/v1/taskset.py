"""The taskset: produces typed tasks and owns scoring.

A `Taskset` is the data + judgement half of an environment. It yields typed
`Task`s, may expose tools via `tools`, and defines rewards/metrics as
decorated methods. All task framing lives in each task's user prompt (baked in by
`load_tasks`); the harness drives control flow.

It is the single judgement authority, scored at two granularities (execution lives in
the Rollout — per-rollout — and the Episode — group — which call these):
  - `score` runs `@reward`/`@metric` over one trace (in its live runtime).
  - `score_group` runs `@group_reward` over all the rollouts of one task at once —
    pairwise/preference rewards that compare samples.

For a heterogeneous taskset (different verification per task), have a single
`@reward` branch on a typed task field.
