"""An episode: evaluate one task — its rollout(s) and all scoring across them.

An Episode is the largest unit the *evaluator* knows about: it runs `n` Rollouts of one
task (each a single trajectory) under a shared concurrency limit, then scores across
them. Per-rollout `@reward`/`@metric` already ran inside each Rollout; the Episode adds
the cross-rollout `@group_reward` stage — pairwise/preference rewards that compare a
task's rollouts. n=1 is just an episode with a single rollout.

These are env-level *rewards*. Training-time transforms of rewards — advantages (GRPO,
RLOO), on-policy distillation — are deliberately NOT modeled here; they sit a level
above, in a trainer that consumes episodes. That's why this is an "Episode" and not a
"group": nothing here computes an advantage.

Each Rollout tears its own runtime down (see rollout.py), so the Episode owns no
runtimes — only the rollouts and the scoring across them.
