"""A rollout: one trajectory — drive an harness in a runtime and score its trace.

A Rollout owns a single trajectory end-to-end, including its runtime's lifecycle. It
makes and starts the runtime, gets an interception endpoint (a slot on the shared pool if
one is given, else a per-rollout server exposed via its own runtime), then drives the
staged lifecycle while the runtime is live — taskset + harness setup, the harness run,
taskset `finalize`, and per-rollout `@reward`/`@metric` scoring — each under its own stage
timeout (`setup_timeout`/`harness_timeout`/`finalize_timeout`/`scoring_timeout`),
then tears the runtime down in a `finally`. Cross-rollout `@group_reward`s run afterwards (in the Episode) over the traces
alone — they never need a live runtime — so a runtime is never kept up past its own
rollout. The runtime ref is set the instant it's created, so it's always tearable-down
even if `run()` crashes.
