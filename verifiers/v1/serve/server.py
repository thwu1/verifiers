"""The env server: load a taskset once, run rollouts on request by task index.

A ZMQ ROUTER front end (msgpack frames) over a v1 `Environment`. The server
owns the environment — taskset, harness, runtime — and is the only process that ever
loads it. A caller (e.g. the orchestrator) stays env-agnostic: it asks `info` for
the task count + whether group scoring is needed, then `run_rollout` / `run_group`
by task index. Per request the server resolves a `Client` from the request's
`client` config (cached, so a renderer's tokenizer is built once), wraps it in a
`RolloutContext`, and runs `env.episode(task, ctx, n).run()`, returning each
`Trace` as a JSON dict (with its computed `branches`).

Minimal port of `verifiers.serve` (ROUTER + msgpack), single async process: each
request is its own `asyncio.Task`, so many rollouts run concurrently. No worker
pool / heartbeats yet — the rollout's own runtime already isolates execution, and
the structure leaves room to add a pool later. Health is just another request type
(no separate socket), which is enough at this scale.
