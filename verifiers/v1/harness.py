"""The harness: a program that runs in a runtime and drives the conversation.

A `Harness` provisions itself into the already-started runtime, then runs there;
its model calls hit the interception server, which records the turns. Provisioning
runs during rollout setup; only execution counts against the harness timeout. The
runtime and the interception server are owned by the Rollout.
